                    <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
                    <p> This version of the classic Hangman game challenges players to guess the name of a famous video game character. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the game presents the player with a series of blank spaces representing the letters in the character's name. Players can guess one letter at a time, with each incorrect guess bringing them closer to "hanging" the character. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the character's name or exhausts their allowed attempts. The blend of traditional Hangman mechanics with video game culture makes for a fun and engaging experience.</p>
                    <p>Come try out the game for yourself!</p>
